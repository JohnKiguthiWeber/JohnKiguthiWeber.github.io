            Hello, my name is John Kiguthi. 
            I am a freshman at Weber State University who is majoring in computer science and minoring in mathematics.
            I have enjoyed math throught my whole life, and gained an interest in computer science during 7th grade.
            During my free time I enjoy going on walks and playing video games.
            This site has been developed to show projects produce for/during my WEB 1430 class.
